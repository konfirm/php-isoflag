# ISO Flags
The Unicode Consortium has made it possible to convert the two letter region codes (defined in ISO-3166, alpha2) into their flag representation, this library does this for you in PHP.

## Installation

```
$ composer require konfirm/isoflag
```

## Usage

```php
<?php 

use Konfirm/ISOFlag/Flag;

$nl1 = Flag('NL');
$nl2 = Flag::NL();
```

## API

###Flag::{iso}()

The static `__callStatic` implementation is used as factory to create new instances. Simply invoke the ISO-3166 alpha2 region code as method name.
These instances are cached and re-used to allow for instance comparison.

```php
<?php 

use Konfirm/ISOFlag/Flag;

$flag = Flag::ES();

if ($flag === Flag::es()) {
	//  both are the exact same instance
}

if ($flag === new Flag('ES')) {
    //  new instances are never fully identical
}

if ($flag == new Flag('ES')) {
    //  they do compare to be similar
}
```

NOTE: instances created using the `new Flag(...)` constructor are _always_ fresh instances.


### Flag::hasFlag(string iso)

The static `hasFlag` method quickly determines whether or not a Flag instance can be created for the specified ISO-3166 alpha2 code.

```php
<?php 

use Konfirm/ISOFlag/Flag;

if (Flag::hasFlag('US')) {
	//  the 'US' region has a flag
}

if (Flag::hasFlag('QQ')) {
	//  this is never reached
} else {
	//  'QQ' is not a valid region :()
}
```

### $flag->toHTMLEntities()

Characters in HTML can be represented by their character index within the unicde standard, ISOFlag provides the hexadecimal notation of these entities.

```php
<?php 

use Konfirm/ISOFlag/Flag;

$flag = new Flag('CH');
$entities = $flag->toHTMLEntities();

// &#x1F1E8;&#x1F1ED;
```

### $flag->toUnicodeSymbol()

Represent the flag as its unicode emoji

```php
<?php 

use Konfirm/ISOFlag/Flag;

$flag = new Flag('DK');
$symbol = $flag->toUnicodeSymbol();

// ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡°
```

### (string) $flag

Flag instances can be turned into string, it is the same as using `toUnicodeSymbol()` on the instance

```php
<?php 

use Konfirm/ISOFlag/Flag;

$flag = new Flag('SE');
$symbol = (string) $flag;

// ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª
```
